This repository contains a simple Sudoku solver built using Python. The project includes an interactive interface developed with Streamlit, allowing users to input an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and visualize the solution. The motivation for this project came from solving the [New York Times (NYT) Sudoku game](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku) and the [Leetcode "Sudoku Solver"](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/description/) problem.
You can run the program as: streamlit run main.py
